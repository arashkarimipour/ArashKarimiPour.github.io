            <h2>Welcome</h2>

            <div class="description-box">
                <p>
                    Dr. Arash Karimi Pour is a licensed Professional Engineer in the United States (U.S.), 
                    providing structural and forensic engineering consulting services. His expertise includes design and 
                    condition assessment of buildings and structures, strengthening and failure and investigations, 
                    settlement and cracking in slabs and foundations, and soil/structures interaction. 
                    He has designed and evaluated residential and commercial structures, deep and shallow foundations, 
                    retaining walls, and tunnels, as well as assessed structural damage due to wind, fire, ground settlement, 
                    water intrusion, excessive vibration, and material aging and degradation. He has led a diverse range 
                    of projects across various sectors in the U.S., including steel, concrete, masonry, and wood 
                    design and retrofit. Additionally, he has overseen building projects from the first stages of 
                    conceptual design to design development and construction drawings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the roles and responsibilities as a Professional Engineer during various phases of 
                    demolition and construction, Dr. Karimi Pour offers expert support in projects involving structural 
                    failure, damage and investigation, service issues, disputes over construction defects, and cost 
                    overruns and delays associated with design and construction modifications. For a variety of building 
                    and structure types, Dr. Karimi Pour has carried out several on-site inspections to look at 
                    performance concerns with the frame, foundation, roofing, building enclosure, soil erosion, 
                    flood, and slope stability. He has addressed problems associated with design, construction materials, 
                    construction methods, construction failures, the application of codes and standards, repair methodologies, 
                    and the cost of repairs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dr. Karimi Pour is also skilled in utilizing non-destructive tests and advanced finite element method 
                    simulation to detect and analyze the failure and structure’s stability in various structural systems. 
                    He conducted small- and in-field experimental evaluations, performed advanced finite element method analysis, 
                    developed a new formulation for concrete mixture design, and designed rigid concrete slabs and risk analysis 
                    to assess the potential failure modes, safety margins, and the long-term durability of rigid concrete slabs 
                    under varying environmental conditions and loads. As a part of his doctoral research, 
                    he worked on various geotechnical research projects to develop innovative foundation design methods 
                    and improve soil-structure interaction models for both terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications.
