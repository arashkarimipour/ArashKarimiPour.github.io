        <div class="description-box">
            <p>
                Dr. Arash Karimi Pour earned a Doctoral degree in Civil Engineering from the University 
                of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in 2023. He serves as a senior researcher with the Innovative 
                Structural Engineering and Mechanics Group, where he focuses on advanced materials, 
                structural performance, and computational analysis. Dr. Karimi Pour spent four years as a 
                Research and Teaching Assistant in the Department of Civil Engineering at UTEP, collaborating 
                on major research projects. He has been affiliated with UTEP since 2019 and was a standing 
                member of the Center for Transportation Infrastructure Systems (CTIS) from 2019 to 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dr. Karimi Pour completed his graduate studies in Structural Engineering at Ferdowsi 
                University of Mashhad (FUM) and brings more than a decade of professional experience as a 
                senior civil engineer and researcher. His work spans finite element methods, retrofitting 
                of concrete members, sustainable construction materials, and advanced computational modeling. 
                His current research focuses on improving the structural performance of sustainable materials, 
                computational mechanics, constitutive modeling of civil engineering materials—including soils, 
                concrete, and asphalt—advanced materials and devices, and the behavior of materials under 
                extreme environments. He also serves as an editor for multiple scientific journals and is an 
                active reviewer for leading publishing organizations including Elsevier, Wiley, ASCE, and Springer.
